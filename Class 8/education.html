                    My favorite class at MIT was AI911: Controlling
                    Superintelligence.

                        I really enjoyed giving speech after winning the Nobel
                        Prize for creating the "Big Red Button" to save
                        humanity.

                        I really enjoyed winning an argument online after
                        winning the Turing Award for creating world's first
                        Superintelligent Machine using HTML (haters will say
                        that HTML is worthless).
