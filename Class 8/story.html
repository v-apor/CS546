                There was a very rich cowboy named "Aelon Moosek". He was a good
                guy, proven by his track record of sharing good memes on
                twitter.

                In the futuristic year of 2025, modern AI systems took over.
                Moosek posted a poll on twitter asking if he should buy
                everything. And as expected, the poll resulted in a big yes.

                He ended up making a deal with the leading AI firm "MegaHard:
                ClosedAI"). Now he control over all the AI systems in the world,
                but he was still disappointed because all of them were bots.
